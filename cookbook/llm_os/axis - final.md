Platform Update Documentation: Enhanced Voice Communication and Advanced Mapping Features

Welcome to the latest updates to our aviation platform, focused on enhancing voice communication capabilities and refining our mapping functionalities. These improvements are designed to streamline operations and enhance user interaction with the platform. Below, we detail the significant changes and new features introduced in this update.

Voice Communication Enhancements

Introduction of Voice Groups:

Voice Capability Integration: We've integrated the ability to communicate directly with aircraft via voice, using specific types of terminals equipped with Viasat push-to-talk or SIRTUS enabled devices.

Voice Group Management: Similar to display groups that manage visibility, voice groups control who can communicate with whom. Users and devices need to be added to voice groups to participate in voice communications.

User Interface for Voice Communication: A new icon has been added to the platform interface, representing voice groups. This icon facilitates easy access to voice communication features, allowing users to engage directly with connected aircraft.

Operational Functionality of Voice Groups:

Dynamic Membership: Users can be dynamically added or removed from voice groups, similar to how display groups are managed. Changes to group membership can be made easily through the platform’s user interface.

Interactive Voice Communication: The platform now supports an interactive voice communication system where users can select which voice groups they want to be active in. This selection process is represented by a speech bubble icon, where users can manage their preferences.

Advanced Mapping Features

Mapping Interface and Clustering Enhancements:

Improved Map Visualization: The map interface now includes a new slider for adjusting the background contrast, enhancing the visibility of various map elements under different viewing conditions.

Clustering Functionality: To prevent label overlap and enhance map readability, especially in densely populated areas such as airports, we've introduced a new clustering functionality. This feature groups close-by labels into a single cluster which can be expanded upon interaction.

Geofencing and Asset Management:

Geofence Management: Users can now apply geofence settings across multiple points simultaneously, simplifying large-scale operations. This new functionality allows for more efficient management of spatial boundaries and associated alerts.

Asset Visibility and Management: Enhanced icon animations now reflect the operational status of aircraft more clearly. For instance, icons for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft display spinning blades at varying speeds to indicate whether an aircraft is in motion or stationary.

Communication and Notification System Updates

Enhanced Notification and Alert System:

Configurable Alerts: The notification system has been upgraded to provide more detailed and configurable alerts. Users can set preferences for receiving notifications through various channels like SMS, email, or directly through the platform.

Voice Notifications: With the new voice communication features, notifications can also include voice alerts, further integrating the communication capabilities of the platform.

Historical Data and User Interaction:

Voice and SMS Message Logging: All voice communications are logged and stored on the server as playable MP3 files. All SMS messages are similarly logged and stored. Users can access historical messages through a dedicated interface on the platform, which provides a chronological list of all voice and SMS interactions.

Interactive User Interface: The platform's user interface for managing voice groups and communications is intuitive and user-friendly, allowing for quick adjustments and real-time monitoring of voice channels.
